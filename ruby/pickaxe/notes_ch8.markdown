# Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins #
The interesting chapter!

## Inheritance and Messages ##
*Inheritance* allows you to create a class that is a refinement or
specialization of another class.  The original is the *superclass* of
the created class, and the created class is the *subclass* of the
original. (Or commonly referred as parent and child classes).

The *child class* inherits all of the *parent's* public and protected
instances methods.
