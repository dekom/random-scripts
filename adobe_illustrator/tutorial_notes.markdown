## General Notes ##
These are the notes I found related to Illustrator but not of importance
to know in order to use Illustrator.

### RGB vs CMYK ###

*Red, Green, and Blue* are additive colors (add up to white) that are
fit for digital display.

*Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow* are subtractive colors (add up to black)
that are fit for ink print.

The word **gamut** is used to describe a range of reproducible color
with a given set of tools.  When applications describe colors as
"outside the gamut", that implies a loss in translation from one tool
set to the next.

**Fun fact**: Apparently *pure cyan* is problematic for computer screens to reproduce.

Most RGB values can be reproduced by market color printers.  However,
they're unsuitable for film.

## Illustrator Basics ##
Basic illustrator tools & techniques for general creation and editing.

### Selection Tools ###
2 types of selection tools:

1. *Selection Tool*: Used for selecting and moving a shape.  It can also
	 be used to resize a shape.
2. *Direct Selection Tool*: Selects a single anchor point instead of the
	 whole shape.  Used for editing anchor point of a shape. Hold shift to
select multiple anchor points.

### Fill & Stroke ###
*Fill* is the color within a boundary.  *Stroke* is the border of the
shape.

### Manipulating Shapes ###
Use the *anchors* to resize the objects.  Hold **shift** to maintain the
proportion.

Explore the various shape tools!

### Freehand Drawing ###
Use the pencil tool to draw freehand.  Hold *Alt/Option* key for path
closure **while drawing**.

Hold *Alt/Option* key for Smooth Tool **prior to drawing**.

Pencil Tool options:

1. *Fidelity*: Determines how close the path is drawn to your mouse
	 movement.  Set it at a higher fidelity if your not good at drawing
with your mouse (or hand!).
2. *Smoothness*: The higher you set for smoothness, the less anchor
	 point it produces.  Thus, producing a smoother line.

Use the pen tool to draw straight lines from anchor to anchor. When
selecting an additional anchor, click, hold, and drag to create curved
lines.

Hold the *Alt/Option* key while dragging on a anchor to change the
anchor direction.

### Brush Strokes ###
Define a path and then apply the brush effects.

### Path ###
Editing path can be accessed at *Window > Pathfinder*.

**Cheat sheet**:

### Colors & Strokes ###
Colors are pretty rudimentary and needs no explanation.

*Strokes* are the shape outlines. Characteristics of strokes:

* *Stroke Caps* determines the shape of the start and end points of a
	open paths.
* *Miter Limit* determines the shape of the joint points.

Gradient tools are self-explanatory, except that you can add additional
gradient stops right below the gradient ramp.
