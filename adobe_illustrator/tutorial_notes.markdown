## General Notes ##
These are the notes I found related to Illustrator but not of importance
to know in order to use Illustrator.

### RGB vs CMYK ###

*Red, Green, and Blue* are additive colors (add up to white) that are
fit for digital display.

"RGB colors are additive")

*Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow* are subtractive colors (add up to black)
that are fit for ink print.

The word **gamut** is used to describe a range of reproducible color
with a given set of tools.  When applications describe colors as
"outside the gamut", that implies a loss in translation from one tool
set to the next.

**Fun fact**: Apparently *pure cyan* is problematic for computer screens to reproduce.

Most RGB values can be reproduced by market color printers.  However,
they're unsuitable for film.
