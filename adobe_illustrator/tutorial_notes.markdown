## General Notes ##
These are the notes I found related to Illustrator but not of importance
to know in order to use Illustrator.

### RGB vs CMYK ###

*Red, Green, and Blue* are additive colors (add up to white) that are
fit for digital display.

*Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow* are subtractive colors (add up to black)
that are fit for ink print.
