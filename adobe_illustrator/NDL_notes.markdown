Leaving off from my [Vector Diary
notes](https://github.com/dekom/scripts/blob/master/adobe_illustrator/tutorial_notes.markdown),
I decided to pick up this short but (I presume) informative book
designed for non-designers.

These are my notes.

## Vector vs Raster ##

*Raster* images, also known as bitmap or pixel-based images are defined
by their resolution, which defined a specific number of pixels per inch.
Commercial printing images at set to **300 pixels per inch** (300 ppi).
Low-quality images such as web page art is usually set to **72 ppi** (a
common screen resolution).

*Vector* image is a "mathematical description of shapes, fill, colors,
strokes, gradients, and blends".

Vector images do **not** degrade in quality when increasing size, whereas
raster images do.
