Leaving off from my [Vector Diary
notes](https://github.com/dekom/scripts/blob/master/adobe_illustrator/tutorial_notes.markdown),
I decided to pick up this short but (I presume) informative book
designed for non-designers.

These are my notes.

*Note*: All content of this note belong to the book authors.

## Section 1: Before You Begin ##
Illustrator information and setup.

### Vector vs Raster ###
*Raster* images, also known as bitmap or pixel-based images are defined
by their resolution, which defined a specific number of pixels per inch.
Commercial printing images at set to **300 pixels per inch** (300 ppi).
Low-quality images such as web page art is usually set to **72 ppi** (a
common screen resolution).

*Vector* image is a "mathematical description of shapes, fill, colors,
strokes, gradients, and blends".

Vector images do **not** degrade in quality when increasing size, whereas
raster images do.

### Blacks ###
There two types of black:

1. *Pure black*: only black ink
2. *Rich black*: black ink + 20% of each CMYK colors

Rich black is much more opaque and overpowering than pure black.

## Section 2: Before You Draw ###
Overview of workspace and explanation of basic features and tools.

Nothing of much interest, other than to play around with the panels in
Illustrator to learn their functions.

## Section 3: Learn to Be Selective ##
Overview of paths and how to select them.

### Paths ###
All paths are made of segments and anchor points.  *Segments* can be
either straight or curved, while *anchor points* can be "corner points
(to create sudden changes in the path direction), smooth points (to
create smooth change sin the path direction), or cusp points (to combine
a corner point and smooth point)."

Paths are **invisible** unless a *stroke* has been applied to it.
